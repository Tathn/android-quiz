# Quiz App
Simple app that fetches some questions from SQLite database, gets users answers and shows them their score. App was made to get in touch with [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/index.html) and [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/). I've wanted to check Dagger capabilities compared to [Spring Framework](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) Dependency Injection which I used to make my [cinema-reservation-system](https://github.com/Tathn/cinema-reservation-system). It comes out that while Spring DI is performed during runtime and is based upon the usage of Reflection API, Dagger generates implementation of classes used to perform DI in compile time which makes a lot of sense because it makes app use less CPU and fits library purpose of being used on mobile devices.
